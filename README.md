## Overview
Bike rental systems are integral to urban transportation. Predicting demand helps businesses ensure availability, reduce operational costs, and enhance user satisfaction. This project leverages machine learning to predict the total count of bikes rented per day based on historical data.

### Objectives
- Predict bike rental demand using historical data.
- Analyze the impact of environmental and temporal factors on demand.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms for better accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on daily bike rentals with features such as:
- **Date**: Specific day.
- **Season**: Categorical (spring, summer, fall, winter).
- **Weather**: Categorical (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.).
- **Temperature**: Normalized temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity**: Normalized humidity levels.
- **Windspeed**: Normalized wind speed.
- **Holiday**: Binary flag indicating if the day is a holiday.
- **Working Day**: Binary flag indicating if the day is a working day.

## Data Processing
The dataset undergoes the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and remove outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Add features like year, month, day, and weekday. Encode categorical variables.
3. **Normalization**: Scale numerical features for better model performance.

## Modeling Approach
We tested multiple machine learning models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search, and cross-validation ensured the generalizability of results.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was assessed using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared Score**
